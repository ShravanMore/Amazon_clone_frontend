# Amazon_clone_frontend
This project is an Amazon clone, developed using HTML and CSS. It showcases my proficiency in creating dynamic and visually appealing web interfaces. By utilizing the power of Flexbox, I have implemented responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.The project includes a meticulously designed header navbar that closely resembles the original Amazon layout. It features interactive dropdown menus, search functionality, and intuitive navigation, providing users with a familiar and user-friendly experience.
Additionally, the project incorporates a well-crafted footer that complements the overall design. The footer includes essential links, contact information, and other relevant details, enhancing the website's professionalism and completeness.
